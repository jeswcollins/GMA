Group Meeting Automaton -- Automated Reminders and Sign Ups for Leading Events (Google Script)

  - requires Google Calendar and Documents


I wrote this code to smooth the process of choosing a speaker for the weekly group meeting of our laboratory group in Applied Physics/Physics at Harvard.

The hope was that more people would volunteer more frequently for group meeting and that we'd spend less time on awkwardly waiting for someone to volunteer or for our boss to decide who would "volunteer."

I think the GMA did reduce the amount of time spent on scheduling, and may have encouraged people to sign up on their own. 

I did not receive any requests that we go back to the old, GMA-free system.

There was and perhaps continues to be some confusion about whether the GMA is a separate entity from me or just a handle I have been using to sign my emails.
